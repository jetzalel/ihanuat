dynamic rest works by setting the scripting time and break time, with the offset offsetting that scripting/break time by plus or minus the offset minutes  
dynamic rest is always on, can disable by setting scripting time very high  

theres a bug where it sometimes doesn't detect max pests. fix this by turning on taunahi pest cleaner and setting range to 7-8
