uh before you start the macro, use O to open up the config, and stand at the start of farm and click button and then the same at the end to save the start and end positions.  
set your thresholds to trigger the pests and visitors there as well.  
Whatever pest and visitor settings you have will be handled natively by taunahi(including spray, pest trap, wardrobe swap etc), all you have to do is ensure that "Activate during Farming" is off for both Pests and Visitors.  
if you have a ceiling on your farm for easier pests, leave a lil 3x3 open area in the ceiling at the start, even if the start would be in the corner of that 3x3 spot.  
YOU NEED AN AOTE/AOTV FOR THIS, ETHERWARP FUNCTIONALITY COMING SOON  
use K to start the macro.
