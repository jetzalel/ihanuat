before starting, ensure the auto start pest, auto start visitor, and wardrobe swap is off in taunahi settings. Use taunahi's rewarper.

enable visitors, wardrobe swap, equipment swap according to your needs, all can be toggled on or off  
set the start and end of the farm using the button in config while standing on that block in the config.  

if adding a ceiling, have a lil 3x3 gap in ceiling at start, even if said start is in the furthest corner of that 3x3
