use o to open the config and k to start the macro (change in controls accordingly)  
before starting, ensure the rewarper, auto start pest, auto start visitor, and wardrobe swap is off in taunahi settings.  
enable visitors, wardrobe swap, equipment swap according to your needs, all can be toggled on or off  
set the start and end of the farm using the button in config while standing on that block in the config.  

if adding a ceiling, have a lil 3x3 gap in ceiling at start, even if said start is in the furthest corner of that 3x3  
so  
001  
000  
000  
with 1 being start of farm is fine  


oh also wardrobe swap as of now only works on slots 1 and 2, 1 being the farming/killing and 2 being spawning  
only runs on s shape crop/netherwart as of now as well  
change the auto direction and should work on most crops until i add choosing what script to run

dynamic rest works by setting the scripting time and break time, with the offset offsetting that scripting/break time by plus or minus the offset minutes  
dynamic rest is always on, can disable by setting scripting time very high
